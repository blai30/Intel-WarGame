* Total of exactly two players according to Wikipedia.
* Exactly 52 standard cards are dealt with no Jokers.
* A player immediately loses if they do not have enough cards for war.
* Cards added to the board during war are in alternating order with player 1 first.
    * ie. 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, 1C, 2C where 1 and 2 are the player and A, B, and C are that player's card.
